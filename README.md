# python-fundamentals
This repository contains example notebooks from the AI & ML for Engineering graduate program at University of Washington. It is based on lectures and assignments from the repo https://github.com/aidan-hunt/ME-programming-fundamentals, used in "Programming Fundamentals for Mechanical Engineers", a course designed by **Aidan Hunt** and taught at the University of Washington, and notebooks have beed edited by **Michelle Hickner**. 

Lecture notes are provided as both Jupyter Notebooks and PDF files. Some lectures have corresponding .py files. These notes assume that you have already downloaded Python via a distribution of your choice (for engineers, I recommend Anaconda).

## Learning Objectives
After working through this course material, you will be able to:
- Recognize key programming concepts and tools that exist across programming languages, and implement these concepts and tools in Python.
- Utilize Python programming to process real data, perform analysis, and create high-quality graphics.
- Decompose engineering-related programming problems into distinct sub-problems, and develop well-structured, readable code.
